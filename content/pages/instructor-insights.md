### Breakdown by Year

Master's and Doctoral students

### Breakdown by Major

Mainly students in the [MIT Sloan School of Management](http://mitsloan.mit.edu/academic/) and in the [School of Engineering](http://engineering.mit.edu), including students inÂ [System Design & Management](https://sdm.mit.edu) and the [Engineering Systems Division](http://esd.mit.edu). A few students from other fields, such as Architecture, and graduate students cross-registered in other schools or in industries also participated.

### Typical Student Background

Students are required to have some background in system dynamics, and usually have specific interest in applying dynamic models and systems thinking to their own work.
